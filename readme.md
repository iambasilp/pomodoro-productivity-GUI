# Pomodoro Timer Project

## Overview
The Pomodoro Timer project is a simple Python application that implements the Pomodoro Technique, a time management method developed by Francesco Cirillo. The technique uses a timer to break work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks.

## Functionality
The application provides the following features:

1. **Timer Mechanism**: It allows users to start a timer for work sessions, short breaks, and long breaks.
2. **Countdown Mechanism**: It displays the countdown timer in minutes and seconds format.
3. **UI Setup**: It sets up a graphical user interface (GUI) using the Tkinter library for Python.
4. **Timer Reset**: It enables users to reset the timer.
5. **Notification**: It provides visual cues by changing the color of the timer label based on the current session (work, short break, or long break).

## Components
The project consists of the following main components:

1. **main.py**: The main Python script containing the application logic and UI setup.
2. **tomato.png**: An image file used for the background of the timer.
3. **Virtual Environment (env)**: An optional virtual environment for managing dependencies.
4. **requirements.txt**: A file containing a list of Python packages required for the project.

## Dependencies
The project relies on the following external libraries:

- **Tkinter**: Python's standard GUI (Graphical User Interface) package used for creating GUI applications.
- **Math**: Python's built-in math library used for mathematical operations.

## Usage
To run the Pomodoro Timer project:

1. Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
2. Clone the project repository to your local machine.
3. Install the necessary dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
4. Run the `main.py` file using Python.
5. Interact with the timer using the provided buttons:
   - Click the "Start" button to start the timer.
   - Click the "Reset" button to reset the timer.
